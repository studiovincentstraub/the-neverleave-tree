  <p>
    In this other life, I see things<br />
    I could never see.
  </p>

  <p>
    We, who name ourselves<br />
    name others, name them<br />
    the standing ones<br />
    the ones who cannot, should not be<br />
    uprooted for their roots reach down<br />
    we, who name to understand<br />
    and alienate
  </p>

  <p>
    But they, more connected than we’ll ever be<br />
    to the ground below and skies above<br />
    in their greatness<br />
    a shy sensitivity revealed by the tacit trembling<br />
    of the poplar<br />
    to let us know “I’m here”<br />
    if only we, in seeking connection were to<br />
    watch and listen<br />
    to the forest’s song.
  </p>

  <p>
    Listen to the rustling sound,<br />
    Gentle, as someone shifting air,<br />
    or is it paper?<br />
    No, it is the sound of being trapped,<br />
    of someone with fine legs,<br />
    legs to bend and jump high<br />
    a little grasshopper caught in my bedroom lace<br />
    carpet hopper, poor thing
  </p>

  <p>
    I catch him quick, hold him inside my hand<br />
    let him be free
  </p>

  <p>
    how quickly lives can end<br />
    if no one is there to care
  </p>

  <p>
    Ever since this gesture of mine, this in-between<br />
    time, I have collected tiny notes on grass<br />
    written with mushroom ink, so now I know<br />
    there is no life without the Neverleave tree, and<br />
    grasshopper poems dry quickly in the morning<br />
    sun
  </p>

  <p>
    Lying amidst eagle fern,<br />
    wings spread—the plant’s and mine—,<br />
    great oeuvres are spun,<br />
    palaces and pyramids<br />
    a mere attempt<br />
    to be greater than nature, we have removed<br />
    ourselves<br />
    becoming blind to the world’s<br />
    most acclaimed architects
  </p>

  <p>
    Queens of their own bodies,<br />
    illuminated by the morning sun<br />
    I see the fine embroidery<br />
    like crystals<br />
    droplets holding rainbows<br />
    beauty and order not to be feared
  </p>

  <p>
    artistry is woven into the webs of life,<br />
    each weaver, the creator of their own
  </p>
