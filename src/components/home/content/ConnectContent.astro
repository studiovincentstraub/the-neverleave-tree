  <h3>The three voices</h3>

  <p>
    Viviane Straub is the daughter of a visual artist and since 2024 also the mother of her own daughter. Having studied Human Ecology, she is interested in finding alternatives to dominant narratives on how we live with the human and more-than-human world and is currently living and working on Gotland; an island in the Baltic Sea. She is a polyglot and plays the clarinet. To make sense of both her internal and external worlds, she writes poetry and short texts; handwritten and without the use of AI.

    Vincent Straub, born in Iowa in 1997, grew up between Germany and England. He studied social sciences, computer-science, and design, and is currently pursuing a PhD in sociology and genetics at the University of Oxford. In addition to his academic work, his wider practice includes poetry, short prose, conceptual art, and video art. Through his research and creative work, he advocates for a healthier, more nurturing embodiment of masculinity. His works have been exhibited by Tate Collective in London and Blikopeners in Amsterdam, among others. He is the son of Claudia Sacher.
